# Hi there, I'm Mat 👋

I'm a software engineer, passionate about online privacy, clean code, and dark themes 😎

I’m a Certified Scrum Master and currently working as a developer at 1Password. I'm an automation enthusiast, Neovim user, shell power-user, and animal lover.

My favorite programming languages currently are Rust, Go, and Lua. I like making Neovim plugins, command line tools, and other developer tools.
